                  The Secret Life of Blue Whale
                </h3>
                <div class="featured_blog__content">
                  <p>
                    The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal
                    and a baleen whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of
                    29.9 meters (98 ft) and weighing up to 199 metric tons (196
                    long tons; 219 short tons), it is the largest animal known
                    to have ever existed. The blue whale's long and slender body
                    can be of various shades of greyish-blue dorsally and
                    somewhat lighter underneath. Four subspecies are recognized:
                    B. m. musculus in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B.
                    m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda (the
                    pygmy blue whale) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific
                    Ocean, B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean. There is
                    also a population in the waters off Chile that may
                    constitute a fifth subspecies.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    In general, blue whale populations migrate between their
                    summer feeding areas near the poles and their winter
                    breeding grounds near the tropics. There is also evidence of
                    year-round residencies, and partial or age/sex-based
                    migration. Blue whales are filter feeders; their diet
                    consists almost exclusively of krill. They are generally
                    solitary or gather in small groups, and have no well-defined
                    social structure other than mother-calf bonds. The
                    fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations ranges
                    from 8 to 25 Hz and the production of vocalizations may vary
                    by region, season, behavior, and time of day. Orcas are
                    their only natural predators.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    The blue whale was once abundant in nearly all the Earth's
                    oceans until the end of the 19th century. It was hunted
                    almost to the point of extinction by whalers until the
                    International Whaling Commission banned all blue whale
                    hunting in 1966. The International Union for Conservation of
                    Nature has listed blue whales as endangered as of 2018. It
                    continues to face numerous man-made threats such as ship
                    strikes, pollution, ocean noise and climate change.

                    Some fly 11 days nonstop. Others trek 8,000 miles. Each
                    year, thousands of bird species leave home in search of
                    food.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Every spring and fall, a spectacle unfolds in the night sky
                    as millions of birds attempt long, perilous journeys between
                    their summer breeding and wintering grounds.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Most of the thousands of bird species that engage in this
                    annual migration travel at night, when wind currents are
                    smoother and the moon and stars guide their way.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    The birds typically follow established flyways, generally
                    north-south routes that offer the best opportunities for
                    rest and refueling along the way. Multiple bird species
                    share these flight paths as they contend with rough weather,
                    dehydration, starvation, and the threat of predation. (Read
                    more about the legendary treks of migratory birds.)
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Arctic terns, for instance, undertake pole-to-pole
                    roundtrips spanning more than 60,000 miles—a record,
                    believed to be the world’s longest migration of any animal.
                    Other migrations involve birds flying east-west or up and
                    down mountains. Even flightless birds migrate, such as the
                    Adélie penguin, which makes a nearly 8,000-mile trek through
                    frigid Antarctica.

                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Because migration is such an integral part of the avian life
                    cycle, it was likely almost as prevalent thousands of years
                    ago as it is today, says Martin Wikelski, director of the
                    Max Planck Institute for Ornithology and a National
                    Geographic Explorer.

                    Have you ever seen a fish with a flashlight at the top of
                    its head? You will see animals far from imagination id depth
                    of sea. They adapted themselves to the existing condition.
                    This does not only match for Anglerfish but for any time of
                    species down there in depth. There are thousands of animal
                    unknown to common people yet known the to wildlife
                    researchers.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    The anglerfish are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes
                    (/ˌlɒfiɪˈfɔːrmiːz/).[1] They are bony fish named for their
                    characteristic mode of predation, in which a modified
                    luminescent fin ray (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure
                    for other fish. The luminescence comes from symbiotic
                    bacteria, which are thought to be acquired from
                    seawater,[2][3] that dwell in and around the sea.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Some anglerfish are notable for extreme sexual dimorphism
                    and sexual symbiosis of the small male with the much larger
                    female, seen in the suborder Ceratiidae, the deep sea
                    anglerfish. In these species, males may be several orders of
                    magnitude smaller than females.[4]
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Anglerfish occur worldwide. Some are pelagic (dwelling away
                    from the sea floor), while others are benthic (dwelling
                    close to the sea floor). Some live in the deep sea (such as
                    the Ceratiidae), while others on the continental shelf, such
                    as the frogfishes and the Lophiidae (monkfish or goosefish).
                    Pelagic forms are most often laterally compressed, whereas
                    the benthic forms are often extremely dorsoventrally
                    compressed (depressed), often with large upward-pointing
                    mouths
